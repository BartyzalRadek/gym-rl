Category: reinforcement learning
Tags: reinforcement learning

In this survey I list and give brief summary of algorithm applicable to
[OpenAI gym][gym] environments.
OpenAI gym is an open-source toolkit for developing and comparing
reinforcement learning algorithms.
There are algorithms for classic control, Atari games, Humanoid walking.
