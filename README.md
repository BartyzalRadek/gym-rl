This work aims to use reinforcement learning to solve some [gym][1]
environments.

## Checklist

- [ ] write an introductory blog post about reinforcement learning
      with Python examples and publish it on https://podondra.cz
- [ ] make a survey of reinforcement learning algorithms
      which are applicable to gym's problems
- [ ] implement some algorithms from survey and apply them to gym environments
    - [ ] some [Atari 2600][7] environments
    - [ ] *HumanoidFlagrun* from [Roboschool][2]
    - [ ] *Kick and Defend* [competitive self-play environment][3]
- [ ] use Python 3.4 or higher
- [ ] use [pytest][4] to make sure algorithm are correctly implemented
- [ ] for implementation use [NumPy][5] and [pandas][6]
