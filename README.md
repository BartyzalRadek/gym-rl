## Checklist

- [ ] write an introductory blog post about reinforcement learning
      with Python example and publish it on https://podondra.cz
- [ ] make a survey of reinforcement algorithms which are applicable to
      Roboschool problems
- [ ] implement at least five of the algorithms from the survey made
- [ ] apply some of these algorithms to HumanoidFlagrun from [Roboschool][2]
- [ ] competitve self-play
